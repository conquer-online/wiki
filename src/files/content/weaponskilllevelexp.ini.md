# WeaponSkillLevelExp.ini

This file maps weapon skill levels to experience required to obtain the level. Similarly to [WeaponSkillName.ini](weaponskillname.ini.md), this file is not an INI file. It's a CSV file where each new line in the list is a weapon skill level, and each entry has comma delimited fields.
