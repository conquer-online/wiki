# Files

This section documents file formats and provides definitions for various content types.

Files in the Conquer Online game client follow some consistency in format, but are largely different between files. Some files are encrypted by various ciphers, and some files are packed in compressed archives.

## Subsections

* [Compression](compression/README.md): File types meant for compressing content into a single file.
* [Content](content/README.md): File types specific to content needed for the client renderers.
* [Formats](formats/README.md): Formats for how to read various file types.
