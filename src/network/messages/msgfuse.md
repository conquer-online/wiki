# MsgFuse

This message is sent by the client to request fusing materials to an item. Though the system isn't officially used by non-Chinese Conquer Online or translated in the interface, it is implemented in the client and can be utilized by private servers. Fuse rates come from [fuse.ini](../../files/content/fuse.ini.md), and successfully fused items result in a +1 stone (according to unverified sources).

Some private servers have repurposed this interface to quickly attempt a socket on an included item using meteor scrolls and other loose meteors.
