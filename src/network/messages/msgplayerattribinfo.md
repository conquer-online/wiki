# MsgPlayerAttribInfo

This message is sent to the client to initialize the battle statistics panel with various damage and defense attributes, and is sent after the [MsgUserInfo](msguserinfo.md) and [MsgItemInfo](msgiteminfo.md) messages to finish displaying equipped items. When a player's equipment is observed by another player using [MsgAction](msgaction.md), then this message is also sent to finish populating equipment.

New attributes were introduced with the introduction of Refinery, Stabilization, and Chi.
