# MsgSyndicate

This message is sent between the client and game server to request and respond to guild-related actions, such as joining and leaving a guild, managing allies and enemies, disbanding the guild, and more. Similar to [MsgAction](msgaction.md), the server responds to MsgSyndicate with either a specific action message (such as querying for the [MsgSyndicateAttributeInfo](msgsyndicateattributeinfo.md) message) or with the MsgSyndicate message itself (such as for applying for membership).
