Conquer Online is written in TQ Digital's custom game engine, called Conquer III (C3). The C3 engine is originally built on DirectX 8.1, but has been ported before to DirectX 9 and OpenGL. Although the C3 engine has been open-sourced officially before, it is no longer available and never perfectly matched up with running online games by TQ.
